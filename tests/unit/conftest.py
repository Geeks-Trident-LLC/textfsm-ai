# tests/unit/conftest.py
#
# Several unit tests construct real SDK clients (openai.OpenAI(), anthropic
# .Anthropic(), google.genai.Client(), etc.) - directly in tests/unit/
# providers/, and indirectly via create_orchestrator_from_config() in
# tests/unit/orchestrator/test_orchestrator_factory.py - and only mock the
# network-call methods afterward, so client construction itself never
# makes a real request. But every one of those SDKs - both the
# httpx-based ones and google-genai, which builds its own ssl.SSLContext
# directly - calls ssl.create_default_context() during construction, and
# that function reparses the ENTIRE CA certificate bundle from disk on
# every call (~200-500ms, confirmed via profiling) instead of caching it.
# Across the ~225 tests affected by this, that's the majority of their
# runtime, with zero effect on test behavior - nothing here ever performs
# a real TLS handshake.
#
# Caching ssl.create_default_context() for the test session eliminates
# that redundant parsing (cut tests/unit/providers/ from ~80s to ~15s).
# Scoped to tests/unit/ only (not the repo-wide tests/conftest.py) so
# tests/integration/'s real API calls - which genuinely need normal,
# unmodified SSL behavior - are unaffected.
#
# Must patch the `ssl` module's own attribute (not e.g. httpx's
# re-exported `create_ssl_context` wrapper): every caller here does
# `import ssl; ssl.create_default_context(...)`, an attribute lookup on
# the shared `ssl` module object at call time, so a patch on `ssl` itself
# is visible everywhere without needing to chase down every SDK's import
# style individually.
